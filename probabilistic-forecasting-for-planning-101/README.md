# Probabilistic forecasting for planning 101

**Applied Machine Learning Days 2024**  
Lausanne, Switzerland  

Sunday, March 24, 2024  
from 14h00 to 15h30 and from 16h00 t0 17h30 CET  

Welcome! This is the companion repository of the Probabilistic forecasting for planning 101 workshop.

Join us to explore the fundamental concepts of combining probabilistic forecasting and optimization techniques to make more informed planning decisions. This is a relaxed-paced workshop that only requires basic Python programming experience and focuses on the exploration of key ideas for building and evaluating a planning system. These concepts are applicable in various domains such as retail, energy demand planning, or capacity planning.
Prerequisites: basic Python programming experience and a basic understanding of statistics are required.
