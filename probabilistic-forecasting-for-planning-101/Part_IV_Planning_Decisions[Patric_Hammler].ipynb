        "# 2. Introduction to the Business Case\n",
        "## 2.1 Perspective\n",
        "As a data science consultant engaged by a pharmaceutical company, you provide expertise in optimizing inventory decisions. Under the guidance of Stephanie Brueckner, the head of the commercial department, you have access to a dataset comprising 100 potential future demand scenarios.\n",
        "\n",
        "## 2.2 The Business Case\n",
        "The client, operating a retail warehouse, seeks to determine optimal reorder quantities to facilitate timely replenishment at a factory. The factory, responsible for forecasting demand to plan production capacities, is initiating communication with all retail warehouses to coordinate reorder decisions. The primary inquiry pertains to the retail warehouse's timing and volume of reorder placements throughout the future. The objective is to identify reorder quantities that minimize operational costs, encompassing holding, shortage, and transportation expenses. Adherence to a predefined reorder policy outlined in the contractual agreement is imperative.\n",
        "\n",
        "## 2.3 The Reorder Policy\n",
        "Orders are restricted to once per month and must be submitted within the initial week of each month. Additionally, there exists a 14 days lead time, denoting the duration between order placement and replenishment. The ultimate goal is to determine the optimal reorder quantity for all forthcoming orders, synthesizing available data and pertinent parameters to inform decision-making effectively.\n",
        "\n",
        "## 2.4 Optimization objective\n",
        "\n",
        "### 2.4.1 Holding costs\n",
        "The holding cost results from warehouse operations, which entail expenses such as energy consumption and rental fees, which increase proportionally with inventory levels.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 2.4.2 Shortage costs\n",
        "On the other hand, shortage costs arise from lost sales and potential damage to the company's reputation due to stockouts. Given the critical nature of the pharmaceutical product, particularly its impact on patients' lives, the emphasis lies on avoiding stockouts at all costs, thus warranting a high shortage cost factor.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 2.4.3 Transportation costs\n",
        "Transportation costs encompass all expenses associated with the movement of inventory from the factory to the retail warehouse, covering logistics and pre-replenishment quality assessments. Notably, these costs exhibit minimal variation with quantity and are consistently estimated at 20000 CHF per shipment.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 2.4.4 Optimization objective\n",
        "In our pursuit of optimal reorder quantities, we must strike a delicate balance, considering the trade-off between excess inventory leading to inflated holding costs and insufficient inventory necessitating frequent reorders, which in turn can escalate transportation expenses or result in stockouts. Ultimately, the total cost calculation encompasses the summation of shortage costs, holding costs, and transportation costs.\n",

        "# 3. Simulation Framework\n",
        "\n",
        "We aim to address this optimization challenge through the utilization of a simulation framework. The methodology involves defining a reorder policy, comprising a predetermined list of reorder quantities for each forthcoming month, and applying it within an environment designed to closely mimic real-world conditions. The output of this simulation is the incurred cost, reflecting the efficacy of the reorder policy. Leveraging 100 distinct demand trajectories representing various potential future scenarios, we iterate this process for each scenario and subsequently evaluate key performance indicators (KPIs) such as average total cost or maximum cost. We consider these costs as indicative of the quality of a given reorder policy, using them as the focal point of optimization efforts aimed at identifying the policy that minimizes overall costs. For clarity, we delineate between two integral components within the simulation: the environment and the agent.\n",
        "\n",
        "## 3.1 Environment\n",
        "\n",
        "The environment serves to depict the dynamics of the system, encapsulating the fluctuating inventory levels within the warehouse at each time step. These variations may arise from factors such as incoming replenishments or outgoing inventory resulting from sales transactions. In the context of this workshop, the environment encompasses both a factory and a retail warehouse. Whenever the retail warehouse initiates a reorder, it triggers the generation of a shipment, which subsequently arrives after a designated number of days, defined as the lead time.\n",
        "\n",
        "## 3.2 Agent\n",
        "\n",
        "The agent assumes the responsibility of decision-making within the simulation. In this particular scenario, the agent adheres to a straightforward policy. It evaluates whether the current day falls within the first week of the month. If not, the reorder quantity is set to zero, in accordance with contractual constraints stipulating that only one order per month is permitted. Conversely, if the condition is met, the quantity is selected from a predetermined list of reorder quantities."
