# Applied Machine Learning Days 2024
## EPFL, Lausanne
### Workshops examples and code
In this repo, I regroup the workshops and my notes on machine learning and AI I have attended during the conference at EPFL.
Feel free to add stuff I forgot or correct mistakes.

# Conference Topic
## Join world leaders in AI and machine learning
This global platform draws experts and participants from over 40 countries across industry, academia, and government. Held over four days with keynote speakers, topical tracks, workshops and an exhibition, the event provides the opportunity to hear the latest research and insights in machine learning and to exchange knowledge with experts in the field. Join us at the SwissTech Convention Center on the EPFL campus and be part of the AI and machine learning revolution.

# Probabilistic Forecasting 101

Part 1: Business_Forecasting_with_Point_and_Probabilistic_Forecasts
From Matias_Callara

Forecasting for decision making
The context is the most important in order to understand the outcome of the models
3 levels in a company : Strategic, Tactical ,Operational
How/Where do we want the company in 10 years ?


Strategic = Long-term processes
	background in econometrics, statistichal/mathetmatical

In this course we focus on the problem of operational forecasting level
but it can be applied to any level of the presented levels in the business

In a business we tend to do sequential decisions, one after the other, e.g, one investment after the other
The goal is to develop an applicable policy for the business case defined by the company.

The idea is to touch the job position of a Data scientist in a Pharma company.

Part 2: Practical_Application
From Stephanie_Brueckner


Part 3: Evaluating Probabilistic Forecasts
From Nicolas Riesterer












	
One question still remains:
How to predict the unpredictable ?
