# Probabilistic Forecasting 101

Part 1: Business_Forecasting_with_Point_and_Probabilistic_Forecasts
From Matias_Callara

Forecasting for decision making
The context is the most important in order to understand the outcome of the models
3 levels in a company : Strategic, Tactical ,Operational
How/Where do we want the company in 10 years ?


Strategic = Long-term processes
	background in econometrics, statistichal/mathetmatical

In this course we focus on the problem of operational forecasting level
but it can be applied to any level of the presented levels in the business

In a business we tend to do sequential decisions, one after the other, e.g, one investment after the other
The goal is to develop an applicable policy for the business case defined by the company.

The idea is to touch the job position of a Data scientist in a Pharma company.

One question still remains:
How to predict the unpredictable ?





Stay hungry.
